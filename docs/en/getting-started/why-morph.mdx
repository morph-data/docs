## What is Morph?

Morph is a full-stack Python framework for building and sharing AI and data applications.

With Morph, you can **quickly convert data analysis scripts and custom AI workflows developed in Python into web applications**. Additionally, you can easily share the applications you create with a single command deployment.

## Features of Morph

- üêç **Developed in Python** ... Build web applications using the source code of data analysis and AI development as is
- üé® **Build pages with Markdown** ... Construct UI with MDX files embedding React components
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Unlimited freedom** ... Freely add Python packages, React packages, and OS-level packages
- üîí **Secure hosting** ... Deploy with `morph deploy`, protect data and API keys with built-in user authentication

## Architecture of Morph

### Backend Development

Backend development uses Python. You can freely add Python packages to build data processing and AI workflows.

For data processing, you can use libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. For AI workflows, you can use SDKs from OpenAI and Anthropic, or frameworks like Langchain and CrewAI.

### UI Construction

The UI of the application is constructed using MDX files in Markdown format. MDX files can embed React components.

Additionally, Morph includes commonly used components for AI and data applications, so you can use them simply by placing them in the Markdown.

Since MDX files can use React components, if you are a React master, you can create your own components or use popular component libraries.

## Deployment

The biggest barrier to seriously operating AI and data applications is deployment.

To deploy AI and data applications, you need a web server where Python can run, security is ensured, and the cost is not too high.

Security is particularly the biggest issue. For AI applications, you might be using secret keys for LLM APIs, and for data applications, you might be using SQL connection information. You can't just expose them to the internet recklessly.

Morph provides a cloud hosting environment that meets these conditions. **With built-in user authentication, outsiders cannot access the application**.

Moreover, **deployment is possible with a single command**.
