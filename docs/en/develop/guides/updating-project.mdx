When a new version of the Morph package is released, run the following commands to apply the changes to an existing project.

```bash Shell
pip install -U morph-data

cd my_project
morph clean -f
morph serve
```

By running these commands in order, the project update will be completed.

<Note>
  The `morph clean -f` command deletes the project's cache and updates it to the latest package.
  Be careful if you have made changes directly to the cache directory, as they will be overwritten.
