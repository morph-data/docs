Morph is a framework for building web applications using Python and Markdown. You can build the backend of the application with **Python** and the frontend with **Markdown**.


## Directory Structure

The directory structure of the framework is as follows:

```bash workdir
.
├── src
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── python/
│   └── sql/
├── .env
├── Dockerfile
└── morph_project.yml
```

- `src` ... Directory to place the source code of the data application
  - `pages` ... Directory to place the frontend MDX files
  - `python` ... Directory to place the backend Python files
  - `sql` ... Directory to place the backend SQL files
- `.env` ... File to set environment variables
- `Dockerfile` ... File to build the data application as a Docker container
- `morph_project.yml` ... File to describe the project settings. The framework recognizes the directory where `morph_project.yml` is placed as the root directory.

In addition to these, `requirements.txt` or `poetry.toml` for managing Python packages, and `package.json` for managing JavaScript packages will be placed.

## Start the Development Server

To check the behavior of the data application, start the development server.

```bash Shell
morph serve
```

If the server starts successfully with the above command, you can access the data application by accessing `http://localhost:8080`.

## Customization

Morph provides convenient features for customizing data applications.
To check the functions and features available in SQL and Python, please refer to the [Framework Reference](/reference/ja/framework/morph-project).
For details on the MDX components available for frontend development, please refer to the [Component Reference](/data-application/ja/data-component-table).
