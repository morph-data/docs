In Morph, we build the frontend using MDX. By placing components in MDX files, you can build the UI of your web application.

## Development Flow

Here's the process for frontend development in Morph:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an .mdx file">
    Create a `.mdx` file in the `src/pages` directory to create a page for your web application. The URL is generated based on the file path. (See [File-based Routing](/reference/en/mdx/file-based-routing))
    ```bash
    # Create a page at /yc-companies
    touch src/pages/yc-companies.mdx
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a page title">
    Add a title to your `.mdx` file. The first heading in the page is treated as the title.
    ```md src/pages/yc-companies.mdx
    # Y Combinator Companies List
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Place components">
    Refer to the [Component Reference](https://morph-components.vercel.app/docs/introduction) and place components suitable for your data app. (See [Components](/reference/en/mdx/components))
    ````md src/pages/yc-companies.mdx
    # Y Combinator Companies List

    <DataTable name="yc_companies" height={500} />
    ````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the development server">
    Start the development server to preview your web application locally.
    ```bash
    morph serve
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
