In Morph, you build the frontend using Markdown. By placing components in Markdown files, you can build the UI of your web application.

## Development Flow

The steps for frontend development in Morph are as follows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create .mdx Files">
    By creating `.mdx` files in the `src/pages` directory, you can create pages for your web application. The file name becomes the URL path.
    ```bash
    touch src/pages/new-page-1.mdx
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Page Title">
    Add a page title to the `.mdx` file. The first heading of the page is treated as the title.
    ```md
    # New Page
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Place Components">
    Refer to the [Component Reference](/data-application/ja/data-component-table) and place components suitable for your data application.
    ```md
    # New Page

    ```bash
    morph serve
    ```
