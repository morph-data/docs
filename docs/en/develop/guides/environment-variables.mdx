In the Morph framework, you can set environment variables to be used in your code.

Accessing environment variables is done in the same way as in regular Python code.

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import morph
from morph import MorphGlobalContext

@morph.func
def get_env_value(context: MorphGlobalContext):
    # get env variable named "ENV_NAME"
    env_name = os.environ["ENV_NAME"]
    return pd.DataFrame({})
```

By creating a `.env` file at the root of your project and setting your variables there, the Morph framework will automatically read them.

```bash .env
KEY1=value1
KEY2=value2
```
