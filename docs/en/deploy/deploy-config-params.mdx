## Environment Variables

In the Morph framework, you can set environment variables to be used in your code.

Accessing environment variables is done in the same way as in regular Python code.

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import morph
from morph import MorphGlobalContext

@morph.func
def get_env_value(context: MorphGlobalContext):
    # get env variable named "ENV_NAME"
    env_name = os.environ["ENV_NAME"]
    return pd.DataFrame({})
```

### How to Set Environment Variables

<Tip>If there is a `.env` file in your local project, running the `morph deploy` command will automatically sync the environment variables to the cloud version, allowing them to be used in the deployed environment. In the local environment, environment variables are read from the `.env` file.</Tip>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cloud Version">
    You can create or delete environment variables by pressing the "Update" button on the "Environment Variables" tab of the individual project page.

    Since you cannot edit registered values, delete them once and then register them again if you need to update them.

    <Warning>
    Updating environment variables will reflect in the deployed project, but it takes about 10 seconds to take effect, so please be aware.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local Version">
    By creating a `.env` file in the root of the project and setting the variables, the Morph framework will automatically read them.
    ```bash .env
    KEY1=value1
    KEY2=value2
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## pip Packages

The Morph framework allows you to freely use Python packages published on pip.

## How to Install / Deploy

In Morph, you can freely install pip packages in the projects you build.
If you want to use packages published on pip, add the packages you want to use to the `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file located at the root of the project.
When you run the `morph deploy` command, these files will be read, and the added packages will be available in the deployment environment as well.

### If Using pip

```bash shell
pip install {package_name}
```

### If Using poetry

```bash shell
poetry add {package_name}
```
