Immediately after creating a project, it is in a private state, and only team members who are admin users or users invited to the project can view the deployed data app. However, by changing the settings, you can make it accessible to anyone who knows the link.

## Private / Public

Here, private and public refer to whether the deployed data application can be viewed by non-members. Even if you change it to public, non-team members cannot operate the project on the dashboard or overwrite your project.

| State     | Operation                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Private` | Only team administrators or invited users can view the data application |
| `Public`  | Anyone who knows the link can view the data application                 |

<Warning>
  Enabling public access will allow anyone to view it. Please confirm that the
  content is okay to be viewed by others before changing the setting.
</Warning>
