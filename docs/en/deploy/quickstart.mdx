Morph allows you to easily deploy data applications and share them with your team.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying your locally built data app, ensure you have created a project and generated an associated API key.

Follow the steps below to create a project and an API key.

### Create a Project

<Note>If you already have an existing project, you can skip this section.</Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Log in to the Morph Cloud interface">
        - Morph Cloud: [https://app.morph-data.io/](https://app.morph-data.io/)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a new project from the Projects tab">
        1. After logging in, open the Projects tab.
        1. Click the "+Create" button in the top-right corner to create a new project.
        1. Once the project is created, make a note of the Project ID.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Create an API Key

<Note>If you already have an API key, you can skip this section.</Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an API key from the Settings tab">
        1. After logging in, open the Settings tab.
        1. From the left-hand sidebar, select API Keys under Personal settings.
        1. Click the "+Create" button to create an API key.
        <Warning>
            It is recommended to create API keys with minimal permissions. Handle the API keys carefully to avoid leaks.
        </Warning>
        1. Make a note of the created API key.
    </Step>
</Steps>

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [API Key Documentation](../advanced/api_key).

## Deployment

<Note>
    The following steps require the `morph` command. If it is not installed, run the command `pip install morph-data` to install it.
</Note>

Using your Project ID and API key, follow the steps below to deploy your app.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Set up the morph CLI">
        Run the following command to configure the API key in `~/.morph/credentials`:
        ```bash Shell
        morph config
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set up your project">
        1. Navigate to the root directory of your project:
        ```bash Shell
        cd /path/to/your-project
        ```
        1. Edit the `morph_project.yml` file in the root directory to set the `project_id`:
        ```yaml YAML
        -- omitted --
        profile: default
        project_id: YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        -- omitted --
        ```
        Note: The profile corresponds to the section in `~/.morph/credentials`. Typically, `default` is sufficient, but modify it if you have multiple credentials.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy to the cloud">
        Run the following command to deploy to the cloud:
        ```bash Shell
        morph deploy
        ```
        - To disable Docker cache, use:
        ```bash Shell
        morph deploy --no-cache
        ```
        After deployment, log in to [https://app.morph-data.io/](https://app.morph-data.io/) to verify the results.
    </Step>
