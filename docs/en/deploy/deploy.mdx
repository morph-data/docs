Follow the steps below to deploy using your Project ID and API key.

<Note>
    The following steps require the `morph` command. If it is not installed, run the command `pip install morph-data` to install it.
</Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Set up the morph CLI">
        Run the following command to configure the API key in `~/.morph/credentials`:
        ```bash Shell
        morph config
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set up your project">
        1. Navigate to the root directory of your project:
            ```bash Shell
            cd /path/to/your-project
            ```
        1. Edit the `morph_project.yml` file in the root directory to set the `project_id`:
            ```yaml YAML
            -- omitted --
            profile: default
            project_id: [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
            -- omitted --
            ```
        Note: The profile corresponds to the section in `~/.morph/credentials`. Typically, `default` is sufficient, but modify it if you have multiple credentials.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy to the cloud">
        Run the following command to deploy to the cloud:
        ```bash Shell
        morph deploy
        ```
        - To disable Docker cache, use:
        ```bash Shell
        morph deploy --no-cache
        ```
        After deployment, log in to [https://app.morph-data.io/](https://app.morph-data.io/), and check the results.
