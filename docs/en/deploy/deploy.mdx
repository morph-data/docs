Follow the steps below to deploy using your Project ID and API key.

<Note>
    The following steps require the `morph` command. If it is not installed, run the command `pip install morph-data` to install it.
</Note>

<Note>
   Docker is required to build the Morph application; if you do not have Docker installed, please install it from the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
</Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Deploy to the cloud">
        Run the following command to deploy to the cloud:
        ```bash Shell
        morph deploy
        ```
        - To disable Docker cache, use:
        ```bash Shell
        morph deploy --no-cache
        ```
        After deployment, log in to [https://app.morph-data.io/](https://app.morph-data.io/), and check the results.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set up your project">
        1. Navigate to the root directory of your project:
            ```bash Shell
            cd /path/to/your-project
            ```
        1. Edit the `morph_project.yml` file in the root directory to set the `project_id`:
            ```yaml YAML
            # Profile Section in `~/.morph/credentials`
            profile: default

            # Project ID
            project_id: [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

            # Python Package Manager
            package_manager: pip

            -- omitted --
            ```
            - The `profile` corresponds to the section in `~/.morph/credentials`. Typically, `default` is sufficient, but modify it if you have multiple credentials.
            - The `package_manager` is set to the selected package manager when the project was created. Normally, you do not need to change this. The `morph deploy` command builds based on this setting.
                - If `package_manager=pip` is specified, edit the `requirements.txt` file in the root directory to specify the packages to install in the deployment environment. Otherwise, `requirements.txt` is automatically generated during the build process.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set up the morph CLI">
        Run the following command to configure the API key in `~/.morph/credentials`:
        ```bash Shell
        morph config
        ```
    </Step>
