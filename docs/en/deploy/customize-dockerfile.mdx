Morph allows you to customize the `Dockerfile` within your project to add OS-level packages.

## Default Dockerfile Structure

The `Dockerfile` generated by the `morph new` command is structured as follows:

<Warning>
    The reserved word `MORPH_TASK_ROOT` is a required environment variable for `pip install` to function correctly. Unless you have a specific reason, do not modify it.
</Warning>

```Dockerfile
# Base image for Morph Cloud
FROM public.ecr.aws/i1l4z0u0/morph-cloud:python3.9

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /var/task

# Install Python dependencies with poetry
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt --target "${MORPH_TASK_ROOT}"

# Copy source code and dependencies
COPY .morph/frontend/dist /var/task/.morph/frontend/dist
COPY .morph/core /var/task/core
COPY .morph/meta.json .morph/
COPY morph_project.yml .
COPY src ./src

# Command to run the Lambda function
CMD ["core.morph.api.app.handler"]
```

## Adding Packages

The base image for Morph Cloud uses `yum` as the package manager. You can use the `RUN` command in your `Dockerfile` to add required packages.

- The Morph Cloud base image is built on Amazon Linux, so package additions should be performed using the `yum` command.

For example, the following addition to the `Dockerfile` installs the `curl` package:

<Note>
    To reduce image size, it is recommended to run the `yum clean all` command after adding packages to remove unnecessary cache files.
</Note>

```Dockerfile
# Base image for Morph Cloud
FROM public.ecr.aws/i1l4z0u0/morph-cloud:python3.9

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /var/task

# Install OS-level dependencies
RUN yum update -y && yum install -y \
    curl \
    && yum clean all
