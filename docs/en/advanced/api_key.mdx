## Setting / Using the API Key

By executing the following command in the CLI, the API Key will be saved in `~/.morph/credentials`.

```bash Shell
morph config
```

`~/.morph/credentials` will be registered with the authentication information for each profile.
You can also change the settings by directly editing the contents of `~/.morph/credentials`.

```
[default]
api_key = [API_KEY]

[profile_name]
api_key = [API_KEY]
```

<Tip>If you do not specify a profile, `default` will be used. You can switch the profile specified in the project by specifying the profile in `morph_project.yml`.</Tip>
