## Connecting to Stripe

For an overview of connectors, please refer to the following link.

  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Connector">
        Select the "Connectors" tab on the top page and press the "Create" button.
        <img src="/assets/images/docs/advanced/connectors/connect-data-platform-connection.png" alt="Connection" />
      </Step>

      <Step title="Enter Stripe Authentication Information">
        Select Stripe and press the sign-in button.

        <img src="/assets/images/docs/advanced/connectors/connect-data-platform-stripe-create.png" alt="Stripe Connection Create" />

        After entering the information, press the Create button to complete the creation. If there are any errors in the parameters, an error will be displayed, so please check the connection details again.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Retrieve access_token from the Created Connector">
        Once the creation is successful, you can retrieve the connector name from the list display.

        Use the dedicated function to enter the connector name in the Python code and retrieve the access_token.
        <CodeGroup>
        ```python Python
        import morph
        from morph import MorphGlobalContext
        from morph_lib.api import get_auth_token


        @morph.func
        def main(context: MorphGlobalContext):
            access_token = get_auth_token("connection_name")
            # ↓↓↓ Process using access_token ↓↓↓
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local Version">
    <Info>In the local version, you currently need to directly write the authentication information in `~/.morph/connections.yml`. For other methods, please create them in the dashboard.</Info>

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Edit connections.yml">
        If the file does not exist in `~/.morph/connections.yml`, create it beforehand and then edit it.
        ```bash shell
        mkdir ~/.morph
        touch ~/.morph/connections.yml
        ```

        ```yaml
        connections:
          stripe-connection: # Unique arbitrary name
            type: stripe # Fixed
            method: stripe_oauth # Fixed
            refresh_token: str
            client_id: str
            client_secret: str
            redirect_uri: str
            access_token: str # Optional
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use the Connector in Code to Retrieve Data">
        Use the dedicated function to enter the connector name in the Python code and retrieve the access_token.
        <CodeGroup>
        ```python Python
        import morph
        from morph import MorphGlobalContext
        from morph_lib.api import get_auth_token


        @morph.func
        def main(context: MorphGlobalContext):
            access_token = get_auth_token("connection_name")
            # ↓↓↓ Process using access_token ↓↓↓
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    Refreshing the access_token is a feature of the dashboard, so the one described will always be used in the local environment.

    <Warning>
        When actually specifying a connector and executing the file, the priority is as follows.
        Also, please note that only connectors created in the dashboard can be used in the environment where `morph deploy` is performed.
        1. Connectors described in `~/.morph/connections.yml` on the local machine
        2. Connectors registered in the cloud
