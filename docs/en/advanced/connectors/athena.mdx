        After entering, press the Create button to complete the creation. If there are any errors in the parameters, an error will be displayed, so please check if the connection details are correct.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect to the Created Database">
        Once created successfully, you can obtain the connector name from the list display.

        Enter the created connector name in the SQL or Python code to retrieve data.
        <CodeGroup>
        ```sql SQL
        {{
            config(
                connection="connection_name"
            )
        }}

        select * from table_name
        ```

        ```python Python
        import morph
        from morph import MorphGlobalContext
        from morph_lib.database import execute_sql


        @morph.func
        def main(context: MorphGlobalContext):
            df = execute_sql(
                sql="SELECT * from table_name"
                connection="connection_name"
            )
            return df
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local Version">
    <Info>In the local version, you currently need to directly write the authentication information in `~/.morph/connections.yml`. Please create it in the cloud version if you prefer other methods.</Info>

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Edit connections.yml">
        If the file does not exist in `~/.morph/connections.yml`, please create it beforehand and then edit it.
        ```bash shell
        mkdir ~/.morph
        touch ~/.morph/connections.yml
        ```

        ```yaml
        connections:
          athena-connection: # Unique arbitrary name
            type: athena # Fixed
            access_key: str
            secret_key: str
            session_token: str
            region: str
            catalog: str
            database: str # Optional
            work_group: str # Optional
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Retrieve Data Using the Connector in Code">
        Enter the created connector name in the SQL or Python code to retrieve data.
        <CodeGroup>
        ```sql SQL
        {{
            config(
                connection="connection_name"
            )
        }}

        select * from table_name
        ```

        ```python Python
        import morph
        from morph import MorphGlobalContext
        from morph_lib.database import execute_sql


        @morph.func
        def main(context: MorphGlobalContext):
            df = execute_sql(
                sql="SELECT * from table_name"
                connection="connection_name"
            )
            return df
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    Refreshing the access token is a cloud version feature, so the one specified will always be used in the local environment.

    <Warning>
        When actually specifying and executing the file with the connector, the priority is as follows.
        Also, please note that only connectors created in the cloud version can be used in the environment where `morph deploy` is performed.
        1. Connectors listed in `~/.morph/connections.yml` on the local machine
        2. Connectors registered in the cloud
