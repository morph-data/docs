title: "Executing Functions - postData()"
---

You can use the `postData()` function to execute Python or SQL on the backend.

```typescript
postData<T>(
  name: string,
): {
  run: (variables?: Record<string, unknown>, key?: string) => Promise<void>;
  running: (key?: string) => boolean;
}
```

### Parameters

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  Specify the name of the Python or SQL to be executed.
</ParamField>

### Return value

An object is returned that contains the `run` and `running` methods for managing the execution state.

- `run(variables?: Record<string, unknown>, key?: string)`: Executes the backend function. Pass any variables you want to send to Python or SQL via `variables`.
- `running(key?: string)`: Returns whether it's currently running. Specify `key` to differentiate if multiple backend functions are executed.

```tsx
export const { run, running } = postData("do_something");

<Button onClick={() => run({ id: "id-1" })} isLoading={running()}>
  Run
</Button>;
```

#### About key

If you have a UI that can be executed from multiple places, by specifying `key`, you can distinguish which place triggered the function.

```tsx
export const { run, running } = postData("do_something");

<Button onClick={() => run({ id: "id-1" }, "id-1")} isLoading={running("id-1")}>
  Run with id 1
</Button>

<Button onClick={() => run({ id: "id-2" }, "id-2")} isLoading={running("id-2")}>
  Run with id 2
</Button>
```
