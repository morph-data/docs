<Warning>
  We strongly recommend using data components whenever possible. They cover the components required for data applications and are actively maintained.
  
  Additionally, within markdown files, you can use the `loadData` and `postData` functions.
</Warning>


You can also use Python scripts built with Morph as APIs. APIs are generated using the [alias](/docs/ja/develop/guides/alias) assigned to the Python function according to the following rules.

### `/cli/run/${alias}/json`

You can obtain the **DataFrame** returned by Python in JSON format. The response is in the following format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    {
      "count": 2,
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 30
        },
        {
          "name": "Bob",
          "age": 40
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### `/cli/run/${alias}/html`

You can obtain the **HTML string** returned by Python in HTML format. The response is in the following format:

```json
{
  "data": "<div>...</div>"
}
```

### `/cli/run/${alias}`

You can directly execute the Python function.
