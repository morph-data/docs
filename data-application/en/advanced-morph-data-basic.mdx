title: "Communicating with the Backend"
---

There are two ways to communicate with the Morph backend from an MDX file: using data components and utilizing the data API.
As part of the data API, `loadData()` is available to retrieve execution results of Python or SQL, and `postData()` is provided to execute them.

In either case, data retrieval requests are handled internally by Morphâ€™s web API.
When the backend receives a request, it executes SQL or Python.

<Note>
  We strongly recommend using data components whenever possible. They cover the
  essential components needed for data applications and are actively maintained.
</Note>

If predefined components such as table views or Plotly-generated graphs are available, please use them.
If you need to perform complex operations on the frontend, consider using the data API.
