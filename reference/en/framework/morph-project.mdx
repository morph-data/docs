title: 'morph_project.yml'
---

The `morph_project.yml` file is a configuration file used when running the Morph framework. When you create a Morph project using the [`morph new`](../cli-commands/new) command, a file with default values is automatically generated.

```yaml
# Profile Section in `~/.morph/credentials`
profile: default

# Project ID
project_id: xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx

# Connection
default_connection: DUCKDB

# Source Directory
source_paths:
- src

# Result Cache (seconds)
result_cache_ttl: 0

# Python Package Manager
package_manager: pip
```

## Parameters

<ParamField body="profile" type="string" default="default">
    Specifies the profile to be used. Selects which profile from `~/.morph/credentials` configured using the `morph config` command should be utilized.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="project_id" type="string" default="null">
    Specifies the ID of the project created in the Morph cloud. This is mandatory when using cloud connectors or performing deployments.

    You can retrieve the project ID from the individual project page on the Morph cloud.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="default_connection" type="string" default="DUCKDB">
    Sets the default database connection. If no connection is explicitly defined in the `config` function of an SQL file, this default connection will be used.

    **Reserved Words**

    The following reserved words can be used without defining a connection:

    - `DUCKDB`: DuckDB is used as the database engine.
    - `MORPH_BUILTIN_DB`: Morph's built-in PostgreSQL database engine is used.

    To configure a custom connection, set the connection name in the `config` function, consistent with this setting.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source_paths" type="string" default="src">
    Specifies the directories to be used as source paths. Files within these directories are recognized as executable source code in Morph.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="result_cache_ttl" type="integer" default="0">
    Defines the cache expiration time in seconds for data pipeline execution results. If results are available within the specified duration, they will be retrieved from the cache.
    Setting `result_cache_ttl: 0` disables caching.
    This parameter affects the results cached during the execution of the [`morph serve`](../cli-commands/serve) command.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="package_manager" type="string" default="pip">
    Specifies the Python package manager to be used in the project.
    When creating a project with the [`morph new`](../cli-commands/new) command, the selected package manager (either `pip` or `poetry`) will be set in this parameter.

    Available options:
    - `pip`
    - `poetry`
    - `uv`
</ParamField>
