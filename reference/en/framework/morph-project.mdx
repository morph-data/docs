The `morph_project.yml` file is a configuration file used when running the Morph framework. When you create a Morph project using the `morph new` command, a file with default values is automatically generated.

```yaml
# profile `~/.morph/credentials`
profile: default

# Project ID
project_id: xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx

# connection
default_connection: DUCKDB

# src directory
source_paths:
- src

# result cache(seconds)
result_cache_ttl: 0

# Python Package Manager
package_manager: pip
```

<ParamField body="default_connection" type="string" default="DUCKDB">
