The application's URLs are generated based on the paths of mdx files.

Examples:

- `src/pages/new-page-1.mdx` -> `/new-page-1`
- `src/pages/new-page-2/index.mdx` -> `/new-page-2`
- `src/pages/new-page-3/sub-page.mdx` -> `/new-page-3/sub-page`

Additionally, the following are reserved words with special meanings:

- `src/pages/_app.tsx`
  You can set up a global layout. Child routes are placed within the `<Outlet>`.

- `src/pages/404.tsx`
  You can set up a global 404 page.
