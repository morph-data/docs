Morph comes with pre-built components that you can use out of the box. Refer to the [Component Reference](https://morph-components.vercel.app/docs/introduction) to place the appropriate components for your data app.

Here's an example of displaying data using the [`<DataTable/>`](https://morph-components.vercel.app/docs/components/data-components/data-table) component:

```md src/pages/index.mdx
<DataTable
  loadData="yc_companies"
  height={500}
/>
```
