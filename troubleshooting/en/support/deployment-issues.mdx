# Build Errors

If `morph deploy` fails, refer to the following to identify the problem.

#### `Deployment failed: [MESSAGES]`

This error indicates that the deployment of the data app to the Morph cloud environment failed after the build process was completed.

Please note that deployment will fail if the built image exceeds 10GB. In this case, check the `Dockerfile` in the project root and remove any unnecessary files or directories.

If the source data used for analysis is large, consider using Morph's Built-in Postgres or external storage instead of including it in the `Dockerfile`.
